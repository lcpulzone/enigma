## Self Evaluation

### Functionality
- I would evaluate my functionality at a Meets Expectations.  I implemented an encrypt and decrypt method in my Enigma class that utilize both the crypt class and key class, these methods can handle special characters and uppercase characters.  The encrypt/decrypt command line interface successfully intakes a message, encrypts it and creates a new file with the encrypted message decrypted.


### Object Oriented Programming
- For this I would give myself a below expectations (or barely meeting expectations), looking at the methods I created they could have been broken up more.  While most of the methods have one responsibility there are a few that are responsible for creating a domino effect, this should have been broken up more.  Creating a module would have helped support single responsibility for methods as well as creating another class.

### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
- I evaluate myself as Meeting Expectations, the code is properly spaced and indented (taking into account my OpenDyslexic font), class names and variable are written with developer empathy in mind.  Naming convention was thought of with the mindset of "If someone looked at my code would they know what this variable or method was responsible for?".  There are a few methods that are over 10 lines which is why I would not evaluate this as Above Expectations.

### Test Driven Development
- I evaluate myself as Meets Expectations.  This project has mocks & stubs successfully implemented and is 99.15% covered as per the coverage folder.  Code was driven from tests that were written before hand.  Where applicable edge cases where taken into account.  I would not evaluate this as Above Expectations because there could have been more implementation of mocks and stubs that would have made testing more robust.
